 * How to Find Middle Element of Linked List in Java in One Pass in Java

 *
 * How do you find middle element of LinkedList in one pass is a programming question often asked Java and
 * non-Java programmers in telephonic Interview. This question is similar to checking palindrome or calculating
 * the factorial, where Interviewer sometimes also ask to write code. In order to answer this question candidate
 * must be familiar with LinkedList data structure i.e. In the case of singly LinkedList, each node of Linked List
 * contains data and pointer, which is the address of next Linked List and the last element of Singly Linked List points
 * towards the null. Since in order to find middle element of Linked List you need to find the length of LinkedList,
 * which is counting elements till end i.e. until you find the last element of Linked List. What makes this data structure
 * Interview question interesting is that you need to find middle element of LinkedList in one pass and you donâ€™t know
 * the length of LinkedList. This is where candidates logical ability puts into the test,  whether he is familiar
 * with space and time trade off or not etc.
